		<h2>About Me </h2>
			<p>Enthusiastically committed to my education, I am currently pursuing a BSc in Ethical Hacking at Abertay University. My enthusiasm for knowledge propels me to stay at the forefront of advancements in the field. I achieve this by actively engaging with InfoSec news and immersing myself in various online cybersecurity challenges on platforms such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box during my free time. Additionally, I am keen on undertaking the CompTIA Pentest+ exam to further enhance my skills.</p>
	
			<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively contribute to the vibrant Ethical Hacking society at Abertay. In this dynamic community, I participate in insightful talks, hands-on practical sessions, and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. This involvement not only enriches my learning experience but also fosters a collaborative and supportive network within the field.</p>

    			</br>
	    
			<p>Extending my commitment to the broader cybersecurity community, I dedicate my time and skills to volunteering for events like the Securi-tay conference. Recognized as the largest student-led information security conference in Europe, I find it rewarding to contribute to its success. This year, I presented a talk on AI in social engineering at the conference.</p>
			
			<p>Highlighting my practical proficiency, I proudly secured 4th place in the UK Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge. In this challenging competition, teams from UK universities played advisory roles to the Cabinet Office during a simulated cyber-attack on the UK. This experience underscores my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and reinforces my commitment to making meaningful contributions to the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
			
			<p>Throughout my coursework, I've undertaken diverse projects, ranging from developing keylogging software and Dictionary Cracker to conducting penetration tests on Windows, Linux, and Web Servers. My proficiency extends to utilizing tools such as Metasploit, NMAP, Nessus, and Burp Suite, with a solid understanding of both Linux and Windows operating systems. For my honours project I am currently focused on developing a social engineering toolkit that harnesses the power of AI to enhance attack capabilities for Pen-Testers.</p>
