		<h2>About Me </h2>
			<p>I am a student at Abertay University pursuing a BSc in ethical hacking. As a self-motivated learner, I strive to continuously broaden my knowledge of the field. 
			I regularly keep up with current InfoSec news and have taken multiple online cyber security courses in my free time through platforms such as Udemy and TryHackMe. 
			My goal is to eventually take and pass the OSCP exam. In addition to my studies, I am a member of the Ethical Hacking society at Abertay and have attended various 
			talks and practical sessions, as well as participated in CTFs.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
			During my coursework, I have worked on several projects, including writing keylogging software, an NTLM Dictionary Cracker utilizing GPU parallelization, and conducting 
			penetration tests on Windows, Linux and Web Servers using tools such as Metasploit, NMAP, Nessus, and Burp Suite. I am also familiar with Linux and Windows operating systems.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
			In my free time, I enjoy photography and playing the drums. 
			I also have a passion for music production and songwriting.
